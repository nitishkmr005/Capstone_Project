Sample Dataset Description - 

There are 16 classes (15 diseases, and one for "No findings") in the full dataset, but since this is drastically reduced version of the full dataset, some of the classes are sparse with the labeled as "No findings"

1) Hernia - 13 images
2) Pneumonia - 62 images
3) Fibrosis - 84 images
4) Edema - 118 images
5) Emphysema - 127 images
6) Cardiomegaly - 141 images
7) Pleural_Thickening - 176 images
8) Consolidation - 226 images
9) Pneumothorax - 271 images
10) Mass - 284 images
11) Nodule - 313 images
12) Atelectasis - 508 images
13) Effusion - 644 images
14) Infiltration - 967 images
15) Covid-19 - "Yet add"
16) No Finding - 3044 images
